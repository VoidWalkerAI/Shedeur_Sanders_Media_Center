​🏈 SS2 x BROWNS: THE "DAWG POUND" OMNI-PLAYER
​👑 DEDICATION
​THIS SOFTWARE IS FORGED EXCLUSIVELY FOR QUEEN SHEBA.
The most dedicated, unshakeable, die-hard Football Fan to ever walk the earth.
​This is not an app store toy. This is a custom-built, high-fidelity audio/video engine designed to match her intensity. When the game is on, or when the hype music is playing, she deserves Pro-Grade tools.
​⚡ FEATURES (THE SPECS)
​1. The Omni-Media Engine
​Three Modes: Music, Video, and Audiobooks.
​Universal Import: Drag and drop MP3s, MP4s, WAVs. The system sorts them automatically.
​Async-Loader: Upload 50 songs at once? No problem. The system queues them up without freezing the phone.
​2. The "Dawg Pound" Visualizer
​Real-time frequency analysis.
​Color Palette: Deep Brown (#311D00) to Neon Orange (#FF3C00) to White Hot peaks.
​Reacts instantly to the beat of the music.
​3. Pro-Grade Controls
​Speed Control: Cycle between 1.0x, 1.25x, 1.5x, and 2.0x (Perfect for watching game film or listening to podcasts).
​Shuffle Engine: True randomization for playlists.
​Auto-Flow: Music seamlessly plays the next track when one finishes.
​4. The Vault (Database)
​Technology: IndexedDB V2.
​Function: It saves the music directly into the browser's secret storage. Even if she closes the tab or restarts her phone, her library is there when she comes back.
​🛠️ INSTALLATION (CRITICAL)
​IMPORTANT: Because this player uses a powerful database to save files, it works best when Hosted on the Web, not just opened as a file.
​Save the Code: Take the index.html file we forged.
​Host It: Go to Netlify Drop.
​Drag & Drop: Drag the file there. It will give you a secure link (HTTPS).
​Deliver the Gift: Send that link to Queen Sheba.
​Add to Home Screen: Tell her to open the link on her phone -> Tap "Share" -> Tap "Add to Home Screen." It will now look and act like a native app.
​🎮 USER MANUAL
​How to Load Music:
